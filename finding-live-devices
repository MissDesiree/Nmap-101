Host Discovery – Finding Live Devices with Nmap
Before scanning ports, you need to know what devices are online. That’s where host discovery comes in. Nmap can identify active hosts on a network using different techniques such as ping sweeps, ARP requests, and TCP handshakes.

Why is this important? In large networks, knowing which devices are up and communicating can help you map your environment or identify unauthorized devices.

Example command:

bash

nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
This command will ping all devices in a subnet and report which ones are online. It’s fast, efficient, and incredibly helpful in both small and enterprise networks.

Host discovery is often the first step in any penetration test or network audit.
